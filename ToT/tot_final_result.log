To determine the possible next steps, we need to perform operations between any two of the numbers in the list. These operations can be addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. We consider each pair of numbers and apply all possible operations. Let's assume an example input of numbers: \(a, b, c, d\).
After performing each operation, replace the pair of numbers with the result of the operation and leave the remaining numbers unchanged. Repeat this process to explore all possible outcomes until you reach a desired value or exhaust possibilities.

TOT sol:
5. 13 - 2 = 11 (left: 9, 13, 11)
To determine the possible next steps using the numbers 9, 13, and 11, we can perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) between any two numbers. Here are the possible next steps:
3. **Multiplication:**
4. \(8 \times 8 = 64\) (left: 2 14 64)

Evaluating 1354th instance:
3 7 9 13
TOT sol:
13 - 7 = 6 (left: 3 6 9)  
9 + 3 = 12 (left: 6 12)



Evaluating 1355th instance:
2 4 10 10
TOT sol:
2 + 4 = 6 (left: 6 10 10)  
2. **Subtraction:**
   - 14 - 8 = 6 (left: 2 6 8)
6 * 2 = 12 (left: 8 12)

Evaluating 1356th instance:
